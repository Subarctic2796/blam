# Blam Language
This is a hobby language called `blam`. It is intended as a learning project, to learn about language development.
It is heavily inspired by [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com), the [wren](https://wren.io/) language, [Writing A Compiler In Go](https://compilerbook.com/). It is based on a [stack based vm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine).

git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Subarctic2796/blam.git

make build
